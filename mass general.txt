major projects
	- data sharing portal (external sharing)
		- consortium of data of critical care neurology (EEG of patients)
		- human sleep project (collect 100k polysomnograms + EHR data)
	- landmark project #4 (internal sharing)
		- sharing data within hospital system
		- capture telemetry
		- be able to find patients with certain properties
	- Deploying ML/AI algorithms into clinical workforce

====================================


python for preprocessing
using sql server
linux server
once data is de-identified


=====================================

Junior is with Mass General Bringham

Building data lake of medical device data
EEG, ECG, bedisde monitors, telemetry
Goal - ETL, build data lake, make available to community to query and access

Other projects related to machine learning, more deeply neuroscience side.

Role mostly ETL part

Junior leads engineering team. has background in CS

hadoop, SQL, NoSQL, Python

get bedside telemetry (HO7 messages), have to dedcde how to accept, transform, process the data.


Brandon is MGH side, director of CDAC
Two teams, officially will merge at some point

Now is mostly ETL, at some point in the future may do ML/AI

engineering team reports to Junior, CDAC,

every 2 weeks do sprint planning, SCRUM, Stand-up 11am EST
